            <h3>Live in the moment</h3>
            <img src="live-in-the-moment.avif"  height="700" width="800"><br><br>
         One of the most important ways to connect with nature is to truly be present in the moment. Modern society trains us to live a fast life, from scheduling meetings to beating traffic to eating fast food. We live in such a fast-paced world that we forget to focus and savor the present moment. 

To build a connection with nature, you must first detach yourself from all the noise and channel your energy towards nature experiences. You can practice this by first taking out a few minutes within the day to detach yourself from the busy schedules, take deep breaths and spend time taking in the trees, birds, and everything within your natural surroundings. 

<h3>Get a good spot</h3><br><br>

<br>Getting a good sit spot can help you maintain consistency in developing a nature connection. When you step outside, find a spot to sit that provides a view of the scenery nature offers. Having a regular place to sit and spend time in natural surroundings helps you appreciate and pay attention to weather patterns as well as the daily or monthly cycles of animals and plants. 
<br><br><br>
<h3>Watch animals</h3> <br><br>

Animals are cute, intelligent, and sometimes entertaining. You can watch the day-to-day life of these animals and even pick a few lessons from them. Taking time out to watch the ants move up a tree or a squirrel go down a hole can help you feel more deeply connected with nature. You can watch the day-to-day life of these animals and even pick a few lessons from them.

Creating the time to do this as often as possible or perhaps when you need a distraction or a moment out will help you feel more grounded with the natural world around you. 
<br><br><br>
<h3>Take a walk, run or hike</h3><br><br>

Watching the dawn or the end of a day can bring feelings of peace and tranquillity. You could spend time every morning watching the sunrise right from your window. If you are feeling anxious after a long day, you could take a stroll to a park or a favorite hideout that gives you a good view of the sunset and simply enjoy the view of a beautiful evening sky.
